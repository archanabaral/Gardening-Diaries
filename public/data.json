    "description": "A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosaceae, or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars.They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa.Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies."

    "description": "Snakeplant is an evergreen perennial plant forming dense stands, and spreading by way of its creeping rhizome. which is sometimes above ground, sometimes underground. Its stiff leaves grow vertically from a basal rosette. Mature leaves are dark green with light gray-green cross-banding and usually range from 70–90 centimetres long and 5–6 centimetres wide, though it can reach heights above 2 m  in optimal conditions.After they have been propagated, the care of snake plants is very easy. Put them in indirect sunlight and don’t water them too much, especially during the winter. In fact, it’s better to let these plants dry out some between waterings."

    "description": "succulent plant, are plants with parts that are thickened, fleshy, and engorged, so as to usually retain water in arid climates or soil conditions. It is a characteristic that is not used scientifically for the definition of most families and genera of plants because it often can be used as an accurate characteristic only at the single species level. The word succulent comes from the Latin word sucus, meaning 'juice', or 'sap'.Succulent plants may store water in various structures, such as leaves and stems. The water content of some succulent organs can get up to 90–95%.In horticultural use, the term succulent is sometimes used in a way that excludes plants that botanists would regard as succulents, such as cacti."
